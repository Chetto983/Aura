# Card description vector implementation plan

**Status (2026-10-16):** PARTIAL.
- **Landed on master:** Tasks 0 to 8, in 6a8f1aaf9, 84ac521f0, bba43ff65, 39a9f7290, 8ec1df3ed,
  a70640dad, b33096b3d, 003fd665d, 97fec747e, and, after the operator's ruling on the route,
  the PRD amendment before b026a5c4d and b026a5c4d itself. The measurements before them are
  6334cfb1e, 81cae63d9 and 0c48e281d, and the spec is bddef47d0 and 88f0a1557.
- **Measured:**
  - The ingest suite is 218/218 in an image built from master.
  - The billed media calls fall from two to one per re-run of `_extract`.
  - cocoindex 1.0.25 kept every memo: 0 re-extractions over 6,035 files.
  - Acceptance 3: one pass through the real ingest reproduced the five sets exactly
    (verification file, "Through the ingest").
- **Final review** (headless opus, read-only, range 84ac521f0..97fec747e): "with fixes", no
  Critical. Every finding was fixed test-first in one pass, in 4b866593e, the assets and web
  commits after it, and the ingest commit that closes the pass:
  - PDF titles ending in a source extension were dropped (Important).
  - An extensionless file's refusal named nothing (Important).
  - The browser's MIME hint overrode the server's extension-first classification, so a `.pls`
    would have been filed as audio. Graded Minor by the reviewer, re-graded Important for that
    reason.
  - Every unreadable file went through the billed memo.
  - A silent filecard exit left no trace.
  - The chip lost the server's type after a failed PUT.
  - The encryption check's comment overclaimed.
  - Review Focus 3 had no test.
  - Several docs were stale.
- **Open:** Task 10 (the appliance count, the edge publish and the lab VM run).

**Goal:** A document card's vector describes the file and nothing else. Source files can be
uploaded and carry an honest card, and existing libraries get the new vectors without
re-embedding their passages.

**Architecture:** filecard renders one layout two ways: `Render()` is the stored card and
`Description()` is the card without its caveats, cut notice and trailer. The ingest gets both
from one `aura-filecard -json` call in `_extract`, stores the card and embeds the description.
The source-extension list is Go's, and the upload gate, the asset presign and the ingest all
read it. The billed media calls are memoized on the file's bytes, so the one re-run of
`_extract` this release forces bills nothing again afterwards.

**Tech Stack:** Go (filecard, documents, assets), Python 3.12 with cocoindex 1.0.25 (the
ingest), React/TypeScript (cockpit attachments), ArcadeDB, WSL and Docker.

**Spec:** docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-card-description-vector-design.md (approved by the
operator on 2026-10-16; decisions 3 and 5 amended while planning).

## Global Constraints

- No Postgres migration and no ArcadeDB schema change. `IndexedDocument.card` and `.embedding`
  keep their meaning, and only what is embedded changes.
- No new environment variable.
- One list of source extensions, in `internal/documents/filecard/source.go`: 314 extensions,
  the operator's 310 plus `.css`, `.cypher`, `.jsx` and `.mjs`. There is no second copy and no
  parity test.
- No file over 600 lines. Stage explicit paths only and never touch other sessions' files
  (`.claude/settings.json`).
- No paid run without the operator's OK. A corpus reaches no vision route: PDFs are checked for
  a text layer offline first.
- Go tests run from WSL (`scratchpad/cb/wt-go.sh`) on the touched packages, with `-race`. The
  Python tests run in an image built from master (`scratchpad/cb/wt-pytest.sh --build`), against
  `cb-arcade`.

## Review Focus

1. **A card with invalid UTF-8 in it** (the SICK PDF before a70640dad). Go's JSON encoder writes
   U+FFFD, so the card and the description must still agree line for line.
2. **A legacy `.xls` or `.ods`.** Its description must come from the converted file, as its card
   does. A raw `.xls` describes itself as "file, 6 KB".
3. **An image no route can read.** `extract_media` raises `NoVisionRoute` and nothing is
   memoized there. `index_text` returns "", which `_extract` memoizes, and the image stays
   card-only until its bytes change (prd.md §11).
4. **A spreadsheet description at the dense-card size.** `embed.py` cuts the vector's input to
   the token budget, for a description as it did for a card.
5. **A binary named `.go`** (a NUL byte, not UTF-16). The card says Aura did not read it, so the
   description is the name line alone and `_read_text` returns "".

## Decisions taken while writing this plan

- Ruling: no `_describe` memo; `_extract` gets the card and the description from one filecard
  call. A second memo would convert a legacy file twice and save nothing this release, since
  `_extract`'s body changes anyway. Cost if wrong: one local re-extraction per file, already
  paid.
- Ruling: the web client keeps no allowlist copy. It accepts `*`, and the server's presign
  decides; the chip's type comes from `asset.modality`. Cost if wrong: an unsupported file is
  refused after it is picked, with a message naming its type.
- Ruling: a `ModalityUnknown` refusal says `Aura does not read ".exe" files`.
- Ruling: an encrypted PDF skips its Info strings and still reads a plaintext XMP packet.
- Ruling: cocoindex 1.0.25 is taken first, as Task 1, so the upgrade pass runs on the version
  that ships.
- Operator, 2026-10-16: a billed media call is redone only when the document changes. The
  scan's route dependency went with it, and so did the route fingerprint
  (`media.CONFIG_FINGERPRINT`, `aura-media-index -fingerprint`), which nothing else read. Cost:
  a file keeps the description of the route that first read it.
- Ruling: in the billed-memo test a changed content type stands in for changed `_extract`
  code. Both re-run `_extract` with the bytes and the name unchanged.
- Ruling: the billed-memo PRD paragraph (003fd665d) landed after its code (b33096b3d), not
  before. The measurement came from that commit's own RED test.
- A cross-encoder rerank is not a lever here: the operator had already rejected it (spike 070,
  23 s per 15 documents on CPU).

## File structure

## Tasks

- [x] **Task 0: PRD amendment.** 6a8f1aaf9 records the five-set measurement and its perimeter.
- [x] **Task 1: cocoindex 1.0.25.** 84ac521f0. A catch-up over three libraries printed
  `[extract]` 0 times on 6,035 files.
- [x] **Task 2: `Description()` and `aura-filecard -json`.** bba43ff65.
- [x] **Task 3: source extensions owned by Go, and an honest source card.** 39a9f7290.
- [x] **Task 4: uploads accept source files.** 8ec1df3ed: the gate, the derived presign list,
  the web client, and the named refusal.
- [x] **Task 5: encrypted PDF metadata.** a70640dad. `scheda_sick.pdf` cards as
  "Titled: DATA SHEET".
- [x] **Task 6: billed media calls keyed on content.** b33096b3d, with the PRD in 003fd665d.
  The tests in `test_billed_media_memo.py` went RED at two calls each, then GREEN.
- [x] **Task 7: the ingest embeds the description.** 97fec747e. RED twice: on the missing
  `Card`, then on a document vector still made from the card. Ingest suite 220/220.
- [x] **Task 7b: only a changed file is read again.** b026a5c4d, after the operator's ruling.
  RED on the `-fingerprint` call the lifespan made, then GREEN; ingest suite 218/218.
- [x] **Task 8: acceptance 3 through the real ingest.** An image built at 97fec747e
  (`aura-ingest:desc`) made one pass over each `cb-arcade` library: `[extract]` once per file;
  one embedding per card plus the 97 passages of newly readable extensions; no other passage
  re-embedded; no paid call. The five sets reproduced the in-place numbers exactly.
- [x] **Task 9: review and fixes.** One fresh reviewer on the range, given this plan, the spec
  and the Review Focus; its findings fixed test-first (Status above). Go `-race` on the
  touched packages, the ingest suite 220/220, and web 221/221 with tsc and oxlint clean.
- [ ] **Task 9b: push** with the WSL recipe, then read CI for that SHA.
- [ ] **Task 10: publish and the lab VM.**
  - [ ] Count the appliance's images, recordings and text-less PDFs read-only. That count is the
    gate before the edge image is published.
  - [ ] Publish edge and update the lab VM through the updater.
  - [ ] Upload a `.go` and a `.tsx` from the cockpit. Their cards must name them source files,
    `document_search` must find them, and the agent must answer office q07 or q14.
  - [ ] Write `docs/superpowers/verification/2026-10-16-card-description-vm.md`.
